</h1>What is Testing?</h1>
<p>
Testing is the process of evaluating a product to identify any gaps, errors, improvements, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements.
The product is not limited to software; it can be hardware or a physical service too.

<h1>Why is Testing important?</h1>
<p>
Testing has many benefits. Here are some of them:

<****>Product Quality</****>: High quality is an essential requirement for any product. Testing ensures delivery of a quality product to customers.
Customer Satisfaction: The product must meet the customer needs. Testing also ensures that as well.
<****>Security</****>: People are looking for trusted products on which they can rely. Testing helps remove vulnerabilities from a product and make it more secure beforehand.
</****>Cost-Effectiveness</****>: Testing helps identify issues early, and it costs less time and money to fix them. The same can be very expensive in the future or in the later stages of development.

<# >Types of Testing in uTest</# >
There are many types of testing methods and approaches. Here we will only discuss the types of testing we conduct on uTest.

Functional Testing: Testing the features/functionality of a product with the intent of locating issues.
Exploratory Testing: Exploratory Testing allows testers to use their knowledge and experience to identify areas of the product that may be vulnerable to potential failure. This type of testing also allows testers to think outside the box and try different approaches when testing the product.
Regression Testing: Is a type of software testing that seeks to verify that changes or modifications to a system do not result in unintended outcomes. It is typically done after changes have been made to make sure the system still works as it is supposed to.
Smoke Testing: Smoke tests ensure that the core functions of the system still work correctly by running a few basic tests. Regression testing is more in-depth, testing all the features of the system to make sure that all the changes made have not caused any unintended effects.
Usability Testing: Measures how easy to use and user-friendly a product is by testing it with real users. We have a dedicated track on Usability testing here.
Localization Testing: Verify the quality of a product in terms of a particular target culture/locale.
Security Testing: A process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of a product.
Automation Testing: Using an automation testing tool to execute repetitive testing steps, which may be difficult to perform manually.
Payment Testing: At its core, Payment Testing is any test that requires the use of a payment instrument to complete. We have a dedicated track for it here.
Accessibility Testing: Ensures that a product is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age, and other disadvantaged groups.
API Testing: Validates Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The purpose of API Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the programming interfaces. It is one of the most challenging testing types at uTest, and we have a dedicated track for it here.
Voice testing: Testing voice-enabled products with native speakers. It combines functional testing, dialogue verification, usability testing, and payment testing to help companies deliver voice experiences that foster ongoing customer engagement and satisfaction. Learn more helpful details here.
Bug Hunt Testing: This is a robust exploratory test. The goal of this kind of testing is to only find out a specific bug or a specific bug on a specific device or specific type of bug occurs within the testing scope. Testers invited to this cycle should carefully read and understand the overview and the requirements and they must avoid reporting issues that are not in scope.
Examples of bug hunt cycles:

A Bug hunt cycle to catch a crash bug when playing a specific game or using an App
A Bug hunt cycle to find out if testers with a specific device are able to reproduce specific bug(s), etc.
A Bug hunt cycle to catch a freeze/slow loading when opening specific page or section or playing a game
A Bug hunt cycle to find that the App freeze of more than 60 seconds when launching the app after first-time installation or app update
In this kind of cycle, you should always avoid testing other areas, as there is a too specific requirement, and the customer is only interested in this thing, thus reporting out of the testing scope will be rejected as OOS or DNFI which will have a big negative impact on your tester rating.
On-site testing: Visiting a physical location to evaluate the quality of the service and collect feedback. Learn more here.

Note: At uTest, we perform all of the above testing types, but the most common is Functional testing. So in this track, we will only discuss functional testing.
We have dedicated tracks for Usability, Payment, API, and Amazon Alexa Testing. We will add more courses for other testing types as well in the future.
